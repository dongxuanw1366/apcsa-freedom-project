# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Do you ever want to play a fast-paced and immersive shooter game? My game has everything, you start with 2 guns and you just shoot enemies. That's it, you can just use your time on shooting endless waves of enemies.

## Product
* A demo of my project in the browser. People can play my game in the browser and I might play the game as demonstration during the presentation.

## Process
* Code snippets and screen shots. I will show my character and my enemy. The nodes and how I coded the character and enemy to move.

## Conclusion
* Screenshots (my world scene), url to project and a takeaway. What I learned from making a game with a 3D game engine and how I struggled but learned and debugged my code.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
