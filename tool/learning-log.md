I started my journey of learning Godot by watching this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0). Godot is different from the coding tools I used before, I used to just add the CDN into my codespace and work on github. Godot is different however because you have to download their game engine and code in there. I followed the tutorial and downloaded the game engine. Then I started my first project by creating a file inside my godot folder. Now that I am inside the editor, I started to explore around. There are 3 type of scenes and it is the basic to start your project. 2D Scene, 3D Scene and User Interface.
