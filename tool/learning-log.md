I started my journey of learning Godot by watching this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0). Godot is different from the coding tools I used before, I used to just add the CDN into my codespace and work on github. Godot is different however because you have to download their game engine and code in there. I followed the tutorial and downloaded the game engine. Then I started my first project by creating a file inside my godot folder. Now that I am inside the editor, I started to explore around. There are 3 type of scenes and it is the basic to start your project. 2D Scene, 3D Scene and User Interface.

Today I learned how to import assets to Godot. It is really simple and all you have to do is download assets and then just click and drag into godot's files. Then I learned how Godot works and we use nodes which is what you use in godot to make anything. Then you will use scenes to build nodes together into reusable parts. Scenes makes it easy to focus on building one part of the game at a time. We can put scenes inside of scenes which is called nesting.

It is like a scene tree:
Game (Root)
* Player
    * graphics
    * collider
* Enemy
